# 🌐 RealmNet

**Realm-based computing for a decentralized, distributed collective intelligence.**

---

## ✨ Vision

RealmNet is a paradigm shift:  
from centralized platforms controlled by **Big Tech**, governments, or closed ecosystems —  
to **distributed, individual-first ownership of intelligence**.  

At the core is the idea of **intelligence ownership**:  
your AI agents run inside your own containers, acting on your behalf, enforcing your terms and conditions — not the other way around.  

This paradigm builds a world of **distributed collective intelligence** where citizens, communities, and enterprises can collaborate without centralized gatekeepers.

## 🚫 Why Not Blockchain Alone?

Blockchains solved **decentralized transactions**, but fall short on:

- **Controlling computation cycles**  
- **AI orchestration**  
- **Real-time decision-making across domains**

RealmNet fills this gap by focusing on **secure containerized computing + AI coordination**, built on **Kubernetes** and **Istio service mesh** for routing, security, and observability.

## 🔧 What We’re Building

- **InterRealm.io** — the first implementation of the RealmNet vision.  
- **MVP Use Cases** — validating cross-domain coordinated AI orchestration.  
- **Architecture-first approach** — grounded in Kubernetes-native design, not bound to any single framework.  
- **Liberty-driven philosophy** — technology that puts ownership and power back in the hands of individuals and communities.

## 🌍 Historicl Relevance 

- **Distributed Collective Intelligence**  
  Move beyond centralized data silos — enable AI systems to collaborate across domains and borders.  

- **Individual-first governance**  
  Flip the current model: instead of individuals agreeing to corporate "terms & conditions,"  
  corporations and institutions agree to *yours*.  

- **Real-time civic infrastructure**  
  Imagine DOGE (or other tokens) publishing contract payouts in real time,  
  where distributed AI systems across the country instantly process, break down, analyze,  
  and feed intelligence back to citizens.  

This is the **post-platform era**:  
citizens owning their **data** and their **intelligence**,  
while corporations and governments *must* respect those boundaries.

## 🏗 Current Status

- **Active development** on [`interrealm`](https://github.com/realmnet/interrealm).  
- **MVP milestone**: proving routing protocols, SDK runtime, and Kubernetes-based realm orchestration.  
- **Phase 2**: Realm gateways for inter-realm traffic and event publishing.  
- **Phase 3**: Decentralized verification of Realm identities, blockchain-like but purpose-built for secure AI orchestration.

## 🏛 Origins

RealmNet is inspired and backed by [**Krebsnet.org**](https://krebsnet.org),  
a foundation founded by **Duncan Krebs**.
